                            We strive on studying Scripture and providing the explanation of it in the most accurate light that we can. Search The Scriptures is a site that is dedicated primarily to the Christian, challenging our brothers and sisters along with ourselves to dive into the truth of Scripture to see if we have set aside the commands of God to set up our own traditions. To do this we use Scripture to explain Scripture. Please join us on this journey!

                            I would say a majority of Christians believe in some form of a rapture: being caught up into heaven. Even though this is a popular belief it is also one of the most talked about subjects. We don't need reassurance of the virgin birth. We don't need reassurance of the divinity of Jesus. We don't need reassurance of a serpent deceiving Eve. It is the Spirit of God within us that testifies to these things (Acts 5:32). However, we need constant reassurance of a rapture. We will explore some Scriptures to discern the truth and as you read ask the Holy Spirit to bring clarity and testify to the truth.

However, if you look closely at the remainder of the chapter, it is not the righteous who are being taken, but the wicked! The disciples ask plainly, "To where"? Jesus answers by taking a prophecy from Ezekiel 39:17. The wicked will be taken away to be fed to the birds of prey.</p>

The answer is that they have died in the great tribulation and here they are standing before the throne! They have received a double honor, not only do they stand before the Lord before anyone else, they will also reign with Him for a thousand years before the rest of the dead are brought back to life and judged. They and only they are of the first resurrection! All those who died before the tribulation, the righteous and the wicked, will be raised in the second resurrection and judged according to our works. The works of these who died in the tribulation follow them (Revelation 14:13). Make no mistake that these who are dying in the tribulation are the last of the believers.</p>

The rest of the dead did not come to life until the 1,000 years were completed. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection! The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of the Messiah, and they will reign with Him for 1,000 years.</p>

They come in at the end of the age, and receive their pay before anyone else! Back in the Matthew verse Jesus made sure to say, "pay them starting with the last." So now we see those who suffered in the tribulation getting their pay before the rest of us. It is they who are among the first resurrection, not any other group! Let's look further at what Jesus had to say about this particular group as opposed to the rest of the dead. First let's see what He says about these who were beheaded for their testimony:</p>

Take note that this does not happen until the end (harvest time). Also, notice the second action is to "store the wheat in my barn" (1 Thessalonians 4:17).
